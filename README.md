# Talk: Ember.js

[Ember.js: the serious JavaScript framework for responsible
grown-ups](https://vimeo.com/118861609)

This repository holds the slides, notes, and example application presented
during my talk on Ember.js.

The slides were created in Keynote, so you'll need it installed to view
them.

The sample application allows you to create and view messages in a single
chat room. It uses LocalStorage to persist messages across browser
sessions.
